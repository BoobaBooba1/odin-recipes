    <h2>Why Gfuel Kicks Ass</h2>
    Guel kicks ass because its got caffiene and tastes good. it also has got very little calories. I'm supposed to write a paragraph or two about this but there's no way I'm going to so I'm just going to stop typing now.
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Shit ton of caffiene</li>
        <li>Bunch of lead</li>
        <li>1.8 million times the recommended dose of B12</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Take 1 scoop of Gfuel</li>
        <li>You can eat the powder directly if you are hard and skip the following steps. otherwise, put the powder in a cup.</li>
        <li>If you don't have a shaker cup you are gonna have clumps, but stir/shake that baby up!</li>
        <li>Profit</li>
    </ol>
